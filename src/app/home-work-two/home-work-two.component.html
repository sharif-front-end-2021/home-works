<h1>Why Is Website Developement so Important?</h1>
<p>
    As human beings, we pride ourselves on our superb adaptation skills and ability to change with the times. Stemming from this, when the social world shifted from a place of interpersonal connections to internet connections, so did the world of business. There's no getting around it; our digitally-driven lifestyle has given us little choice but to adapt to technology, and if you haven't already, it's time to get a move on. It's a no-brainer; website development is now essential to you as a business person. For your business to generate more business, your voice needs to be heard, your brand needs to be seen, and your goals need to be reached. Website development is the key to making those things happen. The same way an eye is the window to the soul, a website is the window to the business, giving customers a taste of what you have to offer and enticing them to delve deeper for more.

    <h3>Restore Our Earth</h3>
    
        
        <h2>Finally, A Chance For Environmental Justice</h2>
        <p>In order to Restore Our Earth, climate change solutions must center and benefit those most disproportionately impacted by environmental degradation and climate change.</p>

        <p>
    <b>JANUARY 15, 2021</b> <br> <br>
    The legacy of the first Earth Day in 1970 is rooted in the sweeping environmental laws and regulations that followed as a result. Much of this legislation is now under threat today. With less than one week left until the US presidential inauguration, EARTHDAY.ORG is rolling out the policy initiatives we want to see within the first 100 days of the Biden administration, by Earth Day 2021. <a href="https://www.earthday.org/finally-a-chance-for-environmental-justice/" class="btn btn-white">read more</a>
